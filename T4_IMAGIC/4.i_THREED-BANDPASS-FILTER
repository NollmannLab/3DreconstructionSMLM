 Results are stored in the following files
 =========================================
 
 Filtered 3D volume(s)    : modelFilt
 
 
 Follow-up operations include
 ============================
 
 THREED-AUTO-MASKING      : auto masking your filtered 3D volume(s)
 THREED-SURFACE           : viewing the filtered 3D  results
 THREED-FORWARD-PROJECTION: generating forward projections for MRA or angular
                            reconstitution, or generating projected masks
                            imposing on 2D images, input for 3D_RECONST
 EM2EM                    : exporting results to other programs (like CHIMERA)
 
 
Next IMAGIC command suggested: THREED-FORWARD-PROJECTION
